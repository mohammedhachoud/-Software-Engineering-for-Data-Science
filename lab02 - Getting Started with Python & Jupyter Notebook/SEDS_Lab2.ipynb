    "Typical python projects use multiple packages for various tasks and some of the packages are shared between projects. However, sharing same packages between projects can cause problems. A virtual environment is a way to have multiple, parallel instances of the Python interpreter, each with different package sets and different configurations, avoiding the problems caused by sharing.\n",

    "  4. Tape `python --version` to know your current python version used in your <base> enviironment.\n",
    "  5. Create a new conda environment with the same name of your folder project siffixed by `-env`  by taping the following command:\n",
    "    `conda create --name seds-lab2-env python=3.8`\n",

    "s = \"\"\"In 1962, John Tukey described a field he called \"data analysis\", which resembles modern data science. In 1985, in a lecture given to the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, C. F. Jeff Wu used the term \"data science\" for the first time as an alternative name for statistics. Later, attendees at a 1992 statistics symposium at the University of Montpellier II acknowledged the emergence of a new discipline focused on data of various origins and forms, combining established concepts and principles of statistics and data analysis with computing.\"\"\"\n",

    "\n",
    "Now use the above string to perform the following actions. Look up the Standard library help files for strings (like we showed last time) to find the methods required.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Print it to screen completely in upper case.\n",
    "2. Try the following: print(s * 8).\n",
    "3. Try the following: print(s + s). Do these two mathematical operations make sense for strings?\n",
    "4. What is the length of this string?\n",
    "5. How many times does the word \"the\" appear in the string?\n",
    "6. At which position in the string does the word `data science` appear? \n",
    "7. Return a boolean True or False if the string `statistics` is followed by a full stop.\n",
    "8. Replace the instance of 'discipline' with 'field'.\n",
    "9. Replace every space in the above sentence with a newline character, and reprint the sentence to the screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Hint:`\n",
    "\n",
    "The above are all effectively done using what are called methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "A method an attribute of an object.\n",

    "#### More About Lists Indexing and Slicing\n",
    "List are like strings, they can be indexed and sliced. For example lets create a list called `my_list` as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_list = [_ for _ in 'abcdefghi']\n",
    "my_list\n",
    "['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Indexing\n",
    "To retrieve an element of the list, we use the index operator (`[]`). Note that:\n",
    "* Lists are “zero indexed”.\n",
    "* It is possible to use negative indexing (from the end of the list), where `[-1]` returns the last element. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "  0    1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Slicing\n",
    "A slice is a subset of list elements. In the case of lists, a single slice will always be of contiguous elements. Slice notation takes the form\n",
    "`\n",
    "my_list[start:stop]\n",
    "`\n",
    "where `start` is the index of the first element to include, and `stop` is the index of the item to stop at without including it in the slice. So `my_list[1:5]` returns `['b', 'c', 'd', 'e']`\n",

    "['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Stepping\n",
    "The slicer can take an optional third argument, which sets the interval at which elements are included in the slice. So `my_list[::2]` returns `['a', 'c', 'e', 'g', 'i']`\n",
    "```python\n",
