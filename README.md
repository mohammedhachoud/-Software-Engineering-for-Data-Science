## Lab 01: Introduction to Data Science
In this lab, we introduce the basic concepts of **Data Science** and explore various use cases and applications. We also discuss the essential tools and skills required to become a data scientist.

## Lab 02: Getting Started with Python & Jupyter Notebook
This lab covers the basics of **Python programming** and how to use **Jupyter Notebooks** for data science projects. Topics include variables, data types, loops, functions, and more.

## Lab 03: Advanced Concepts for Python Software Engineering: Modularity, Readability, and Refactoring
We dive into advanced software engineering principles, focusing on **modular programming**, improving **code readability**, and the importance of **refactoring**. Best practices for organizing Python code are also discussed.

## Lab 04: Advanced Concepts for Python Software Engineering: Unit Testing, Git, and Github
This lab introduces **unit testing** to ensure code reliability and correctness, along with an overview of using **Git** and **GitHub** for version control and collaboration in software projects.

## Lab 05: Data Processing & Cleaning for Data Science: Data Ingestion and Wrangling with Pandas
We explore how to use the **Pandas** library to ingest, clean, and transform data. Data wrangling techniques are covered in-depth to prepare datasets for analysis.

## Lab 06: Data Wrangling Documents and Web Scraping
In this lab, we focus on **document processing** and **web scraping** to extract useful information from unstructured data sources like PDFs, HTML pages, and web APIs using Python libraries.

## Notebook 07: Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization – Going Deeper
This notebook covers advanced techniques in **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **data visualization** using libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn, allowing us to gain deeper insights from the data.

## Notebook 08: Statistics For Data Science
We delve into **statistical concepts** and their application in data science, covering topics such as descriptive statistics, hypothesis testing, probability distributions, and inferential statistics.

## Lab 09: Web Development for Data Science: Building RESTful API with FastAPI
In this final lab, we learn how to develop and deploy a **RESTful API** using **FastAPI**, which allows for the integration of data science models into web applications and services.
